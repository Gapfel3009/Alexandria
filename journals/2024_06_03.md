- A draw pad for a computer works either via touch technology, which can be used with a special pen. Thanks to the sensors in the pen, the pressure force can be calculated and converted into width. This type of tracking is mainly found in draw pads with a display.  The other type of tracking is via electromagnets in the tablet and pen. When the pen's electromagnet hits the tablet, a voltage is generated by the electromagnets in the tablet. This voltage is translated into a binary signal that represents the mouse position. This technology is mainly used in standard drawpads without a display.
- The touch technology works in a similar way to the electromagnets, except that no voltage is generated but an electric field on the display is interrupted by contact with the pen or finger.
